OpenCV example repository
=========================
This is where I keep my OpenCV examples and the tutorials I've tried.

Try them out
------------
You will need to install OpenCV first. I made a short blog post with the
resources I used [availble
here](http://www.chho.se/2013/03/06/installing-opencv-development-branch-on-ubuntu-12-04/).

I suggest that you build the examples "out of source" that is do NOT run "cmake
.". Instead do the following.

    cd <tutorial_folder>
    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake ../
